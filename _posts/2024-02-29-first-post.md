Well. Finally got around to putting a website together.
It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I use Markdown to author my posts. I use [this blog](https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) as an inspiration.
Since the easy part is now over, the hard part is to regularly post quality content here.
